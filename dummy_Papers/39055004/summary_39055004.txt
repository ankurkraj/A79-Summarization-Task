**Research Question:** This study explores a novel chemical strategy for creating peptidic bispecific antibodies (pBsAbs) that engage macrophages for enhanced immunotherapy. It addresses challenges in bispecific antibody design, such as cost and complexity, while improving therapeutic effectiveness in cancer treatment.

**Methodology:** The authors developed a one-pot peptide cyclization and conjugation method to produce pBsAbs. This involved attaching EGFR-binding cyclic peptides to anti-SIRP-α monoclonal antibodies. The resulting pBsAbs were evaluated for target specificity, macrophage engagement, and cancer cell phagocytosis through binding assays, confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry.

**Key Findings:** The engineered pBsAbs displayed dual specificity, binding both EGFR-overexpressing cancer cells and SIRP-α on macrophages. This dual targeting facilitated macrophage-mediated phagocytosis of cancer cells and disrupted the CD47-SIRP-α "don't eat me" signal, significantly enhancing cancer cell elimination. The pBsAbs retained stability and efficacy in serum and exhibited improved performance in 3D tumor spheroid models compared to unmodified antibodies.

**Implications:** This facile bioconjugation approach provides a robust platform for rapidly generating bispecific antibodies at a reduced cost. The method's versatility and efficacy in improving cancer immunotherapy make it a promising tool for future therapeutic development, particularly in targeting macrophage-mediated immune pathways.

**Limitations:** While effective in vitro, the study lacks extensive in vivo validation to confirm therapeutic potential. Additionally, the scalability and uniformity of the conjugation process require further optimization.

**Conclusion:** The study demonstrates a novel chemical method to construct pBsAbs that efficiently engage macrophages for cancer immunotherapy. This innovation lays the groundwork for cost-effective and customizable bispecific antibody development, potentially advancing clinical applications.
