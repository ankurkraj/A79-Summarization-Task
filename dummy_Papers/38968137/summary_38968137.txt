**Research Question:** The paper addresses the challenge of reducing toxicities associated with conditioning regimens in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), aiming to develop a safer, non-toxic method for preparing patients for transplantation.

**Methodology:** The authors explored a conditioning regimen using a combination of anti-CD47 and anti-CD117 antibodies with JAK1/2 inhibition (ruxolitinib) in murine models. This approach aimed to deplete host hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) without the use of toxic chemotherapy or irradiation, facilitating donor engraftment.

**Key Findings:** The study found that the combination of anti-CD47/c-Kit antibodies with ruxolitinib enabled stable multilineage engraftment in fully mismatched allo-HSCT models, achieving high levels of donor chimerism, particularly in myeloid cells. This regimen also promoted donor-specific tolerance without inducing graft-versus-host disease.

**Implications:** The findings suggest that this conditioning strategy could broaden the applicability of allo-HSCT by reducing conditioning-related toxicities, potentially allowing older or infirm patients to benefit from transplantation. It also shows promise for correcting inherited myeloid lineage deficits, such as chronic granulomatous disease.

**Limitations:** The research is limited by the occurrence of anemia as a significant morbidity factor due to anti-CD47/c-Kit targeting. The study was conducted in murine models, and further research is needed to optimize the regimen and evaluate its safety and efficacy in humans.

**Conclusion:** The study concludes that the combination of anti-CD47/c-Kit antibodies with ruxolitinib offers a promising, non-toxic conditioning regimen for allo-HSCT, eliminating the need
